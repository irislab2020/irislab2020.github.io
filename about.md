### 소개
안녕하세요! 청소년 성소수자 연구모임 **아이리스(iris)** 입니다. 
아이리스는 그리스어로 ‘무지개빛’이라는 뜻을 담고 있습니다. 고대 그리스 신화에 등장하는  아이리스 여신은 무지개를 타고 지상으로 내려와 하늘의 뜻을 전해주었다고 합니다.
청소년 성소수자는 ‘청소년’이라는 이유로, ‘성소수자’라는 이유로 사회에서 오랜 시간 침묵해야만 했던 존재입니다. 
이들의 삶과 고민, 그리고 꿈을 세상에 전하고자 다양한 연구자들이 모였습니다. 아이리스는 청소년 성소수자들이 안고 살아가는 다양한 문제들-아웃팅과 학교폭력, 학업중단, 진로고민 등- 을 주제로 연구 프로젝트를 진행하고자 합니다. 
무지개를 타고 사랑의 메시지를 전했던 아이리스 여신처럼, 청소년 성소수자들이 세상에 전하고자 하는 다양한 메세지를 여러분께 전해드리고 싶습니다.

### Research
Making sense of data is possibly the biggest problem in Neuroscience and beyond. We build algorithms to analyze data. We also use theory as well as computational and [neural modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience) to understand how information is processed in the nervous system, explaining data obtained in collaboration with [electrophysiologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology) and in [psychophysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics) experiments. Lastly, we constrain and develop new technologies aimed at obtaining data about brains.

Our conceptual work addresses information processing in the nervous system from two angles: (1) By analyzing and explaining electrophysiological data, we study what neurons do. (2) By analyzing and explaining human behavior, we study what all these neurons do together. Much of our work looks at these questions from a normative or causal viewpoint, asking what problems the nervous system should be solving. This often means taking a Bayesian approach. Bayesian decision theory is the systematic way of calculating how the nervous system may make good decisions in the presence of uncertainty. Causal inference from observational data promises to be a key enabler for progress in science.

We've pursued projects that involve handshake greetings, human movement, [cell-phone related parkinson's research](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fneur.2012.00158/abstract), competitions at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [meta-science analysis](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7415/full/489201a.html), data sharing initiatives, and [recording from all neurons in a mouse](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002291).

The best way to get a sense of what's currently going on in the lab is to check out the work of individual lab members:

### Lab Members

Our research group is remarkably interdisciplinary. Our interests span statistics, physics, biology, applied mathematics, molecular biology, metascience, cognitive science, and many other disciplines. Visit our [people page](http://kordinglab.com/people/) to see more information on each person who works in the lab (publications, contact information, photos).

### Lab Culture

Our lab is a wonderful spot for anyone who is super driven by curiosity and likes to learn/move through ideas quickly. Instead of one big "lab project", everyone is generally the chief of their own individual projects.

Since our lab includes several fields, we don't have big lab meetings with everyone. Instead, we engage in a number of practices to facilitate good communication in the lab. Currently these include
0. Weekly 'lab teachings' where someone teaches a thing. http://kordinglab.com/2018/08/29/upcoming-lab-teaching.html
0. 'One-on-ones'. Every semester everyone in the lab is expected to sit down with everyone else for an hour.
0. Lab tea time. It's tea! And science. A 10-minute talk by someone about anything, including their current work.
0. Coding overviews. Structured like the one-on-ones
0. A lab hammock, hangboard, and art on loan from the Penn Museum
0. Monday morning donuts @ 9:00am

Every week, more or less, we chat about current lab practices and sometimes vote on new things.
